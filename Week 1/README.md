# **Welcome to Week 1 of Data DaVinci**

This week, we’ll dive into Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Genetic Algorithms.  
Along the way, we’ll also spend some time learning about different techniques to help avoid overfitting and make our models more effective.

**Linear Regression** is a simple statistical method used for predicting a continuous outcome based on one or more input features. The goal of linear regression is to find the relationship between the features and the outcome by fitting a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that best represents the data. It’s commonly used for tasks like predicting prices, temperatures, or other numerical values.

**Logistic Regression** is used for classification problems, where the outcome is categorical (e.g., yes/no, true/false). Despite its name, logistic regression is actually a classification algorithm. It works by estimating the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class, using a logistic function (sigmoid) to squeeze output values between 0 and 1. It is often used for binary classification tasks, such as determining whether an email is spam or not.
